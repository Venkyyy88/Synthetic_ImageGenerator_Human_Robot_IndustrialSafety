* [camera_sampling](basics/camera_sampling/README.md): Sampling of different camera positions inside of a shape with constraints for the rotation.
* [light_sampling](basics/light_sampling/README.md): Sampling of light poses inside of a geometrical shape.
* [entity_manipulation](basics/entity_manipulation/README.md): Changing various parameters of entities via selecting them in the config file.
* [material_manipulation](basics/material_manipulation/README.md): Material selecting and manipulation.
* [physics_positioning](basics/physics_positioning/README.md): Enabling simple simulated physical interactions between objects in the scene. 
* [semantic_segmentation](basics/semantic_segmentation/README.md): Generating semantic segmentation labels for a given scene.
* [camera_object_pose](basics/camera_object_pose/README.md): Load and render models given the intrinsics and extrinsics.
