class Entity(Provider):
    """ Returns a list of objects in accordance to a condition.
    Specify a desired condition in the format {attribute_name: attribute_value}, note that attribute_value for a custom
    property can be a string/int/bool/float, while only attribute_value for valid attributes of objects can be a bool or a
    list (mathutils.Vector, mathurils.Color and mathutils.Euler are covered by 'list' type).

    NOTE: any given attribute_value of the type string will be treated as a REGULAR EXPRESSION.

    An example:
        "name_of_selector": {
            "provider": "getter.Entity"
            "conditions": {
                "name": "Suzanne"   # this checks if the name of the object is equal to Suzanne (treated as a regular expr.)
            }
        }
    Another more complex example:
    Here all objects which are either named Suzanne or (the name starts with Cube and belong to the category "is_cube")
        "name_of_selector": {
            "provider": "getter.Entity"
            "conditions": [{
                "name": "Suzanne",  # this checks if the name of the object is equal to Suzanne (treated as a regular expr.)
                "type": "MESH"      # this will make sure that the object is a mesh
            },{
                "name": "Cube.*",   # this checks if the name of the object starts with Cube (treated as a regular expr.)
                "category": "is_cube" # both have to be true
            },{
                "inside": {         # this checks if the object is inside the bounding box defined by min and max points
                    "min": "[-5, -5, -5]", # or use "outside" for checking whether the obj is outside of b box
                    "max": "[5, 5, 5]"
                },
            },{
                "inside": {         # alternative syntax for inside/outside, cannot be mixed with min/max vector syntax
                    "z_min": -1,    # any object with a z position greater than -1
                    # supported keys: [xyz]_{min,max}
                    # missing arguments extend the bounding box to infinity in that direction
                },
            ]
        }

    This means: conditions, which are in one {...} are connected with AND, conditions which are in the
    list are connected with or.

    In the event that a custom property has the same name as an attribute of the object, the attribute is always
    evaluated first. In order to change let the key start with "cp_". For example there is a custom property with the
    key "type", so checking "type": "MESH" will lead to a problem, because the attribute will be checked.
    To avoid this change the key: "type" to "cp_type".
