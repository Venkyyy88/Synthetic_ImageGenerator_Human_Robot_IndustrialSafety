class Material(Provider):
    """
    Returns a list of materials in accordance to a condition.
    Specify a desired condition in the format {attribute_name: attribute_value}

    The usual conditions might be:
    1.

    "selector": {
      "provider": "getter.Material",
      "conditions": {"name": "wood.*"}
    }

    Here all materials which start with wood are selected.

    2.

    "selector": {
      "provider": "getter.Material",
      "conditions": {
        "name": "wood.*",
        "cf_texture_amount_eq": "2"
      }
    }

    In this example again all materials where the name starts with wood are selected and where the material
    has exactly two texture used. All the elements

    3.

    "selector": {
      "provider": "getter.Material",
      "conditions": {
        "name": "wood.*",
        "cf_texture_amount_min": "2"
      }
    }

    The only difference to 2. is that now the amount of textures must be equal or higher than 2, this option also
    exists with "cf_texture_amount_max".

    4.

    It is also possible to use several OR conditions, by using a list of dicts:

    "selector": {
      "provider": "getter.Material",
      "conditions": [
        {
          "name": "wood.*",
          "cf_texture_amount_min": "2"
        },
        { "name: "tile.*" }
      ]
    }

    This would include all materials which either start with wood or tile. The wood materials also need at least 2
    texture image nodes.
